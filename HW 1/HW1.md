HW 1 Overview


<p>The program reads a csv file that contains employee data, formats the data, store each employee as an employee object, and finally prints out each employee</p>

<p>This program uses the pickle library to store and read employee information and must be installed. To run the program you need to input the location of the employee data as an argument.</p>

<P>In text processing, Python has a lot of useful built-in functions for text processing like split. It also is very simple to parse through text. The main disadvantage I found while working on this assignment are that strings are immutable, but the advantages of immutability outweights the disadvantages.</p>

<p>This assignment was mainly a review of Python for me, I relearned how to write classes and functions. The one new thing I learned is how pickle works and how to use it. </p>
