Rian Johnson's Star Wars trilogy has had yet another update which only sets up for more disappointment. The trilogy was originally announced in 2017 after Johnson pitched an idea thanks to his good relationship with Lucasfilm. This relationship was established during Johnson's work on Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the eighth installment in the Skywalker Saga and the second of Disney's sequel trilogy.Kathleen Kennedy, President of Lucasfilm, stated that the studio was immensely proud of what Rian Johnson had crafted with The Last Jedi, which factored into the decision to give Johnson a trilogy set in the Star Wars universe. However, after the release of The Last Jedi and the divisive fan reactions that followed, updates on the trilogy began to slow. Many thought that Lucasfilm had canceled the project due to said split reaction to Johnson's film, yet there has never been any confirmation of this over the years.Related: Star Wars: What If Rian Johnson Had Directed The Rise of Skywalker?In the years since 2017, both Johnson and Kennedy have been asked multiple times whether the trilogy will still happen. While both still seem confident the films will be made, Johnson's commitment to Netflix and the Knives Out franchise have again delayed production starting on the trilogy. Well, the latest update from Johnson may give fans of the filmmaker and his work on Star Wars new hope on the trilogy happening. However, with a trilogy as turbulent as this, buying into the idea of it happening seems like a surefire way to be disappointed if it doesn't come to fruition. Is Rian Johnson's Star Wars Trilogy Happening? His Latest Update Gives Us Hope          The latest update from Rian Johnson about his Star Wars movies, stating that he and Kennedy have remained in close contact since his work on Star Wars: The Last Jedi, confirms that the filmmaker is still on board for the trilogy and that it is simply scheduling when production can begin that is the issue. Johnson's comments also indicate the filmmaker's love for the franchise that was evident during the production of The Last Jedi. Check out the director's comments on the trilogy during an interview with Empire:I’ve stayed close to Kathleen [Kennedy] and we get together often and talk about it. It’s just at this point a matter of schedule and when it can happen. It would break my heart if I were finished, if I couldn’t get back in that sandbox at some point.These comments are certainly good news for anyone still hoping for the trilogy to happen, indicating that Johnson's heart remains in the Star Wars universe. Also, the director recently doubled down on how proud he is of The Last Jedi, despite the intense fan discourse that still takes place five years after its initial release over aspects such as Luke Skywalker and his death. This proves Johnson hasn't become weary of returning to the universe, and it is clear from Johnson's side that he is merely waiting for Lucasfilm to commit to a production date that lines up with the filmmaker's own schedule, essentially putting the ball in Kennedy's court. Why Star Wars Needs Rian Johnson's Star Wars Trilogy          This is a good move from Johnson, as it is clear that Lucasfilm needs the trilogy to happen more than Johnson does. As mentioned, Rian Johnson secured a huge deal with Netflix over the production of two Knives Out sequels, meaning Johnson has a lot of work in his future with or without Star Wars (despite the filmmaker's obvious desire to return). When concerning Lucasfilm though, the studio is certainly having a hard time bringing Star Wars back to the big screen after the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. With Rogue Squadron's 2023 release looking evermore impossible for Star Wars, and Taika Waititi's film still without a title, finalized script, or release date, Star Wars' cinematic future looks dead in the water.Related: Every Rian Johnson Movie, Ranked From Worst To BestWith only Kevin Feige's apparent Star Wars film left, one which looks unlikely to come anytime soon due to his commitment with Marvel Studios until 2025 and the end of the Multiverse Saga, Rian Johnson's trilogy could be just what Lucasfilm needs to kickstart Star Wars' big screen resurgence. A new trilogy, built in Johnson's mind since 2017, that features a new time period, new characters, and an altogether new story in the Star Wars universe is something fans have wanted since the disappointing end to the Skywalker Saga and is something Lucasfilm definitely need. Why Rian Johnson's Star Wars Trilogy Still (Sadly) Seems Unlikely          Sadly, a Star Wars trilogy from Rian Johnson without Skywalkers still seems unlikely, despite the director's comments and the obvious benefits it would bring to the franchise. One reason for this is the already mentioned deal Johnson struck with Netflix. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery is set to release in the last few months of 2022. Given how the deal between Netflix and Johnson was for two Knives Out sequels, it is likely that Johnson will jump straight into production on the third movie after the release of Glass Onion. This will likely keep Johnson busy until at least 2024 and possibly 2025, meaning the likelihood of Lucasfilm still keeping slots open for any potential Star Wars trilogy for Johnson after this point is minimal.Also, it is clear from Lucasfilm's upcoming slate of Star Wars TV shows that the studio sees TV as the future of the franchise. From Andor, Ahsoka, The Acolyte, Skeleton Crew, Tales of the Jedi, and continuations of The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, The Bad Batch, and Star Wars: Visions, it is evident Lucasfilm are committing wholeheartedly to continuing the Star Wars franchise on the small screen. The lack of clarity on all current Star Wars feature films in development supports this, including Patty Jenkins', Taika Waititi's, and Kevin Feige's, with all boding ill for Rian Johnson's Star Wars trilogy, no matter how unfortunate that fact may be.
