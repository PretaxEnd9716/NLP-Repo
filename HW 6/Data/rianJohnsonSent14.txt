The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper, Fran, finds him dead with his throat slit.
The police believe Harlan's death to be suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate.
Blanc learns Harlan's relationships with his various family members were strained: On the day of his death, Harlan threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his daughter Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his grandson Ransom.Unknown to Blanc, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally mixed up his medications, making her think she overdosed him with morphine, and was unable to find the antidote, apparently leaving Harlan only minutes to live.
Wanting to save Marta's family from scrutiny (her mother being an undocumented immigrant), Harlan gave her instructions to create a false alibi and then slit his own throat.
Harlan's elderly mother saw Marta carrying out his instructions but mistook her for Ransom.
Marta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when questioned.
She agrees to assist in Blanc's investigation, and she conceals evidence of her actions as they search the property.
When Harlan's will is read, to everyone's shock, Marta is the sole beneficiary.
Ransom helps her escape the family's wrath, but he manipulates her into confessing to him; he offers his help in exchange for a share of the inheritance.
The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce the inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother's immigration status.Marta receives a blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report.
She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has burned down.
Marta receives an email proposing a rendezvous with the blackmailer.
Blanc and the police spot them, and after a brief car chase, Ransom is arrested; Blanc explains that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room the night he died.
At the rendezvous, Marta finds Fran, drugged.
She performs CPR and calls an ambulance.
She confesses to Blanc, though Ransom has already informed on her, and she decides to tell the family that she caused Harlan's death, which would invalidate the will under the slayer rule.Back at the mansion, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report in Fran's cannabis stash.
She gives it to Blanc without reading it herself.
Reading it, Blanc sees it showed little morphine in Harlan's system, and interrupts Marta before she can confess.
Blanc reveals his deductions to the detectives, Marta and Ransom: After Ransom learned Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Harlan's medication vials and stole the antidote so that Marta would kill Harlan and thus become ineligible to claim the inheritance.
But Marta actually gave Harlan the correct medication, subconsciously recognizing it by its viscosity, and she only thought she had poisoned him after reading the label.
When the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to expose Marta.
Fran saw Ransom tampering with the crime scene and sent him the blackmail note.
After he realized Marta was not responsible for Harlan's death, but Marta still thought she was, he forwarded the note to Marta and burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of her innocence.
He overdosed Fran with morphine, intending for Marta to get caught with Fran's corpse.Marta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; then she vomits on him, revealing the lie.
Enraged, he attacks her with a knife from Harlan's collection, which turns out to be a retractable stage knife.
With Ransom's murder confession recorded and having witnessed his attempted murder of Marta, the police arrest him.
Linda finds a note from Harlan about her husband's adultery.
Blanc tells Marta he suspected early on that she played a part in Harlan's death, noting a small spot of blood on her shoe.
As Ransom is taken into custody, Marta watches from the balcony of her mansion with the rest of the family gathered below.Cast[edit]Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private detectiveChris Evans as Hugh Ransom Drysdale, Linda and Richard's sonAna de Armas as Marta Cabrera, Harlan's nurseJamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale, Harlan's eldest daughterMichael Shannon as Walt Thrombey, Harlan's youngest sonDon Johnson as Richard Drysdale, Linda's husbandToni Collette as Joni Thrombey, the widow of Harlan's deceased son NeilLakeith Stanfield as Detective Lieutenant ElliottKatherine Langford as Meg Thrombey, Joni's daughterJaeden Martell as Jacob Thrombey, Walt's sonChristopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey, an 85-year old best-selling crime novelist.

The car chase scene goes through the Assabet Woolen Mill (pictured), now known as Mill & Main.After making the 2005 film Brick, the writer and director Rian Johnson came up with the basic concept for Knives Out.
[4] In June 2010, he expressed interest in making an Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery film.
He told The Independent that he wanted to make the film after finishing Looper (2012).
[5] However, Johnson's next film project became Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017).
[6] Johnson spent seven months writing the script after finishing his press tour for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
[7]Johnson cited several classic mystery thrillers and mystery comedies as influences, including The Last of Sheila, Murder on the Orient Express, Something's Afoot, Murder by Death, Death on the Nile, The Private Eyes, The Mirror Crack'd, Evil Under the Sun, Deathtrap, Clue, and Gosford Park.
[8] The 1972 version of Sleuth, a favorite "whodunit adjacent" of Johnson's, was also an inspiration, particularly for the setting and set design, including the automaton, Jolly Jack the Sailor.
[9][10][11] The title was taken from the 2001 Radiohead song "Knives Out"; Johnson, a Radiohead fan, said: "Obviously, the movie has nothing to do with the song ... That turn of phrase has always stuck in my head.
And it just seemed like a great title for a murder mystery.
"[12] The name Harlan Thrombey is taken from a 1981 Choose Your Own Adventure whodunit, Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?
[13]Knives Out was announced in September 2018, with Daniel Craig starring.
It was sold to distributors during the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.
[14] In October 2018, Chris Evans, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Ana de Armas, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Toni Collette joined the cast.
[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] In November 2018, Christopher Plummer, Jaeden Martell, Katherine Langford, Riki Lindhome, and Edi Patterson joined the cast.
[22][23][24] Frequent Johnson collaborator Noah Segan was announced as being in the film in December.
[25][26] In March 2019, Frank Oz, who previously worked with Johnson in The Last Jedi, revealed that he would be appearing in a small role.
[27] M. Emmet Walsh was cast in the film to replace Ricky Jay, who had died during production.
[28]Filming[edit]Principal photography began on October 30, 2018, in Boston, Massachusetts and wrapped on December 20, 2018.
[29][30][31] Other filming locations in Massachusetts included Berlin, Easton, Marlborough, Natick, Wellesley, Maynard, Waltham, and Medfield.
[32][33][34][35][36] The exteriors of the house were filmed at a mansion located in Natick, about 17 miles (27 km) west of Boston.
[32] The Ames Mansion in Borderland State Park, Massachusetts, was used for many interior shots.
[37][32]Music[edit]Nathan Johnson composed the film score.
[38] He previously worked with director Rian Johnson, who is his cousin, on Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper.
The soundtrack was released on November 27, 2019, coinciding with the film's release, by Cut Narrative Records.
[39]Release[edit]Knives Out had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019.
[40] It was theatrically released on November 27, 2019, by Lionsgate.
[41] Director Rian Johnson released an "in-theater" audio commentary for those watching the film a second time.
[42]Knives Out was released on Digital HD on February 7, 2020, and on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K on February 25.
[43] It was made available on the streaming service Amazon Prime on June 12, 2020.
[44]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]Knives Out grossed $165.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $146 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $311.4 million.
[3] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $82 million.
[45]In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Queen & Slim, and was initially projected to gross $22–25 million from 3,391 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.
[46] The film held advance screenings on November 22 and 23, making $2 million from 936 theaters.
[47] It then made $8.5 million (including the $2 million from the screenings and $1.7 million from Tuesday night previews) and $6.8 million on Thanksgiving Day, increasing estimates to $44 million.
It went on to gross $27.2 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $41.7 million), finishing second behind Frozen II.

[51][52]Critical response[edit]On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 467 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10.
The website's critics' consensus reads: "Knives Out sharpens old murder-mystery tropes with a keenly assembled suspense outing that makes brilliant use of writer-director Rian Johnson's stellar ensemble.
"[53] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 52 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
[54] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.
[48]David Rooney, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as an "ingeniously plotted, tremendously entertaining and deviously irreverent crowd-pleaser" and "a treat from start to finish," praising the film's script, the throwbacks to the murder mysteries of the 1970s, and the actors' performances.
[55] Dana Stevens of Slate wrote "Knives Out knows exactly what kind of movie it is: a sendup of twisty murder mysteries with all-star ensemble casts that also loves and respects that silly tradition.
"[56] For The A.V.
Club, A.
A. Dowd called the film "madly entertaining" and "an ingenious sleight-of-hand crowdpleaser".
[57] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an A−, writing "Johnson has devised a murder-mystery that's eager to defy your expectations, but unwilling to betray your trust.
The film may be more smart than stylish, and it may opt for a reasonable outcome over an overwhelmingly shocking one, but Knives Out doesn't let the element of surprise ruin a good story.
"[58] David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that Johnson "turned the whodunit on its head".
[59] Dani di Placido of Forbes wrote that Johnson "finds a way to revitalise the concept" and "makes murder mystery great again".
[60] Director Edgar Wright stated that Knives Out was his favorite film of the year and that it is "fiendishly plotted".
[61]Andrew Chow, writing for Time, described the film as "one of the most unexpectedly subversive films of the year."
Co-producer Ram Bergman said that the sociopolitical elements of the film were essential from its infancy.
The film's lead actress, de Armas, saw it as a major studio release that stars a Latina and condemns entrenched aspects of American society.
[62] Carlos Aguilar, writing for Remezcla, took note of the Thrombey family's "racist worldview", which contrasted how the Latina lead "emerges as a heroine for all immigrants and their children whose most inalienable superpower comes from empathy, civility, resilience and the utmost value for human life.
"[63]It was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and Time magazine as one of the top ten films of 2019 in each respective list.
