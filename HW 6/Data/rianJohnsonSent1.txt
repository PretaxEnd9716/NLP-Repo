[1] He grew up in Denver, Colorado, until sixth grade,[2] when he moved to San Clemente, California.
[1] He attended San Clemente High School (graduating in 1992),[1] where Brick was predominantly filmed.
He attended the University of Southern California and graduated from the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 1996.
[3] Johnson's second short film, Evil Demon Golfball from Hell!!
!, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart", was included as an easter egg on the Looper Blu-ray.
[4]CareerJohnson has said he was inspired to become a film director after seeing Woody Allen's 1977 film, Annie Hall.
"It moved me in a way that very few other films have moved me.
That's something that, I pray to God, if I am able to keep making movies, I can only hope, twenty years down the line maybe, I'll be able to approach.
"[5]Johnson's debut film, Brick, is a crime drama released in 2005 and made for just under $500,000.
Johnson has often said that he looked to the novels of Dashiell Hammett as inspiration for the film's unique use of language.
While the film is classified as a film noir, Johnson claims that no references were made to film noir during production, so as to focus the production away from reproducing a genre piece.
Brick was released on DVD by Focus Features.
[6]Johnson directed the video for the Mountain Goats' song "Woke Up New" in 2006.
He is a professed fan[citation needed] of the band and was asked to direct the video when bandleader John Darnielle noticed a reference to them in the credits for Brick.
A song is credited to "The Hospital Bombers Experience", which is a reference to the Mountain Goats song titled "The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton".
Johnson also directed a live performance film of the Mountain Goats' 2009 album The Life of the World to Come.
The film consists of a single shot, depicting Darnielle performing the entire album on guitar and piano with minimal accompaniment.

[25] He penned the script and co-produced with longtime producing partner Ram Bergman.
[25] Knives Out was released on November 27, 2019, and was a major success with critics, as well as audiences,[26] grossing over $300 million at the box office worldwide.
