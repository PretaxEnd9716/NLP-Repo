Hardboiled by way of Dashiell Hammett, "Brick" was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival and announced Johnson as a fresh new voice in independent film.
From there, he diversified his talents, directing music videos for bands like The Mountain Goats, and helming episodes of "Breaking Bad" (A&E, 2008-2013) and "Terriers" (FX, 2010).
He went on to direct his second feature, "The Brothers Bloom" (2009), which failed to live up to the precedent he set with his breakthrough film.
But he did earn considerable acclaim for his third film, "Looper" (2012), a dark and gritty sci-fi thriller that proved Johnson was a significant filmmaker with a bright future.
That promise was fulfilled when Johnson was announced as the writer and director of "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" (2017).
