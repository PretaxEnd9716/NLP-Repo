After graduating from high school, he went on to attend the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. His first feature film, Brick (2005), was released in 2005 and was the metaphorical building block that launched his career. He is a director, writer, and musician, among other areas of expertise.His second feature, The Brothers Bloom (2008), proved his ability to tell an exciting story with A-list actors, and the visionary Looper (2012) cemented him as a modern science-fiction icon. Among his highest-rated work are three episodes of the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad (2008). His filmography made him a strong candidate to write and direct Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017), the penultimate episode of the 'Star Wars' series. Lucasfilm was pleased with his work and announced that we would write and direct a 'Star Wars' trilogy separate from the main Skywalker story.- IMDb Mini Biography By:                       Antonio F.

Shoots in 35mm film.        Often uses a Mafia or crime syndicate theme.        Often works with cinematographer Steve Yedlin.        In his movies there is usually an orphan character.        Characters often battle an illness or an addiction.        Often uses rural locations as settings.        Use of shadows and darkness.        Frequent use of foreshadowingTrivia (6)      Graduated from USC's School of Cinema-Television in 1996.      Wrote the screenplay for Brick (2005) in 1997.

Cousin of film composer Nathan Johnson.      Annie Hall (1977) was the movie that inspired him to become a filmmaker.      Sarah Shay, the moderator of the Rian Johnson fan site, hopes that he makes his proposed cyberpunk movie.Personal Quotes (4)      Teen movies often have an unspoken underlying premise in which high school is seen as less serious than the adult world. But when your head is encased in that microcosm it's the most serious time of your life.      I bristle a little when the argument for film gets put into the nostalgia ghetto. Film is still the highest quality and best-looking image capture medium available. I don't think it always will be. The digital image will get better, and it will eventually surpass the quality of the film image, but it isn't there yet.      [on the central question posed by Looper (2012)] For me, that's essentially the wrong question [re: "If you could travel back in time and kill someone like Hitler, would you do it? Could you do it?"]. Which is weird, because you could say that, in some way, it's the question that "Looper" eventually puts its chips down on. But for me, the real question isn't 'Would you kill Hitler?' It's 'Does solving a problem by finding the right person and killing them ever work? Or does it create a self-perpetuating loop of violence?' And that to me is not a theoretical, time-travel question. That's a real-world question.      [on if the idea of the "loop" in Looper (2012) is at all influenced by Eastern religion or the notion of karma] - I guess so, yeah. We'd have to talk for another hour about what exactly that means. It's about the notion of breaking that loop because the loop is at the an unhealthy cycle of self-interest motivating violence, which motivates the self interest of someone else, which motivates violence, which motivates -- blah, blah, blah.See alsoOther Works| Publicity Listings| Official SitesView agent, publicist, legal and company contact details on IMDbPro  Getting Started|Contributor Zone »Contribute to This PageEdit pageRian Johnson Personal DetailsBiographyOther WorksPublicity ListingsOfficial SitesContact Info (IMDbPro)Filmographyby Yearby Jobby Ratingsby Votesby Genreby KeywordDid You Know?Personal QuotesTrivia TrademarkPhoto & VideoPhoto GalleryTrailers and VideosOpinionAwardsRelated ItemsCredited WithNewsExternal SitesProfessional ServicesGet more at IMDbProExplore MoreShow LessCreate a list »                User ListsRelated lists from IMDb users Favorite Filmmakers            a list of 22 people            created 23 Aug 2016                      Directors            a list of 48 people            created 29 Jul 2019                      Top Director's            a list of 22 people            created 10 months ago                      Quarterly Club            a list of 35 people            created 1 month ago                      Top Directors            a list of 25 people            created 07 Apr 2015                     See all related lists »                Share this page:Clear your historyRecently Viewed Get the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2022 by IMDb.com, Inc.
