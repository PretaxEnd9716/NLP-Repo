About blogging she went on to say, "I have a Master's Degree in Film Studies, but I’m no more qualified to blog than a high school student in Vermont." The New York Times has called Longworth "freakishly smart",[14] and Variety said, "... it's the ever-proliferating bloggers – Spout, Cinematical, Movie City News and Hollywood Elsewhere – that have become the instant barometers for how a film plays."[15]In 2007, Variety said, "As the pool of well-paid print critics shrinks in size, the next generation of film fans may come to trust critic/bloggers like …  Spout's Karina Longworth, who helped to create the major film blog Cinematical".[16] The New York Times has commented, "Are print critics really so all-important and sacrosanct with the Web full of debates about all manner of film in places like indiewire.com, cinematical.com and blog.spout.com?"[17]You Must Remember This podcast[edit]In April 2014, Longworth launched You Must Remember This, a podcast that covers lesser-known Hollywood stories from the early- to mid-twentieth century.  Distributed by the Panoply network in association with Slate Magazine, there have been 189 episodes so far, all written and narrated by Longworth.[18]  It has become one of the top film podcasts; the Washington Post called it "knowledgeable and laceratingly funny".[19] Podcast Magazine gave the show five out of five mics.[20] The show won the 2016 award for "TV & Film" at the Academy of Podcasters Awards and was a finalist in the 2017.[21][22] The podcast's most talked about series to date was adapted from the unfinished memoir of academy award nominated production designer and film producer Polly Platt. [23]Personal life[edit]Longworth married director Rian Johnson in 2018.[24] She received a special thanks in the credits of Johnson's film Knives Out.Works[edit]The Portable SpoutBlog: Rants, reviews and reports from the film blog edited by Karina Longworth (2009), ISBN 1448695716Masters of Cinema: George Lucas (2012), ISBN 2866429044Al Pacino: Anatomy of an Actor (2013), ISBN 0714866644Meryl Streep: Anatomy of an Actor (2014), ISBN 0714866695Hollywood Frame By Frame: The Unseen Silver Screen in Contact Sheets, 1951-1977 (2014), ISBN 1616892595Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes's Hollywood (2018), ISBN 0062440519See also[edit]List of history podcastsReferences[edit]^ Longworth, Karina, ed.
